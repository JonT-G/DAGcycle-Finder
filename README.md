This was a C program made to deteced cycles if there were any or print out the topological order list of the DAG. Thus only changes/created made were the files Graph.c, Linkedlist.c and cycleDetection.c.
The rest of the files were provided to us. The structure of the txt files for the made dags is: first line is the number of nodes it has. 0 indicting no connection and 1 indication a connection between the two nodes (an inDegree), example:

00010 \
00000 \
00100 \
10100
